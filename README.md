# Book Website with Async/Await and API Fetch

This is a simple web application that fetches and displays book information from an external API using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with async/await.

Development Process
Here's an overview of how this website was created:

Frontend: The website is built entirely using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML structure defines the layout of the page, CSS provides styling, and JavaScript handles user interactions, data fetching, and asynchronous operations using the async/await pattern.

Async/Await: The async/await pattern is used in the JavaScript code to make asynchronous API requests, ensuring that the website remains responsive while fetching data from the API.

API Fetching: I use the Fetch API to make HTTP requests to an external API. The API key, if required, is securely stored in the JavaScript code.

User Interface: The website features a user-friendly interface with a search bar that allows users to search for books by title or author. Search queries trigger API requests, and the results are displayed on the page.

##Implemented Dark Mode Feature

###Dark Mode: The website includes a dark mode feature to improve user experience. Users can toggle between light and dark themes for comfortable reading.
